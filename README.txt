Rockit
    by Robert Feldt

== DESCRIPTION:

Rockit is a potent parser generator and gives you AST's (Abstract Syntax Tree's) which you can pattern match and pretty-print. Rockit does not distinghuish between lexing and parsing so the generated parsers are scanner-/lexer-less. The vision is to extend Rockit with more advanced compiler-related abilities including back-ends and code generation. However, currently the focus is on parsing and AST-related tasks such as transformation.

This is a preview release of the upcoming Rockit 0.9.0. It has 
*VERY LITTLE* in the form of documentation and examples so it is mainly for
*VERY INTERESTED* inidividuals who want to check out what is coming. You are
also encouraged to give feedback on the "pure-Ruby" way of specing grammars.

To keep it simple and focused, lots of stuff that will be in later versions
are not included in this release:

  * Proper memoization (Ã  la packrat)
  * Optimization
  * Error reporting
  * Java grammar
  * Ruby grammar
  * many of the good stuff from older Rockit versions (tree pattern matching, fully automated AST generation etc)
  * GPL only on things related to generation, MIT/BSD on everything needed for
      using the generated parsers etc (as much as possible)

so *BE WARNED*... ;)

Performance will be worse than expected and there will be bugs.

If you still want to check this out I suggest you start with the example in

tests/acceptance/packrat/minibasic

which is a grammar and interpreter for a mini version of Basic.

Since you a *VERY INTERESTED* individual that are previewing this I would
really appreciate if you write down any comments/improvement/problems etc
that you have/encounter while using rockit and email them to me:

Thanks for your interest!
